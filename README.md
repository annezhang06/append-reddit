# Append Reddit

Created December 2025. My first Chrome extension!

## About

When turned on, appends " reddit" to any Google search you make (that doesn't already have "reddit"—case-insensitive—in it).

## How to Install

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?tool=webui&platform=mac) the append-reddit [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) to your folder of choice on your computer. What you have now is an *unpacked* extension on your computer.

2. Load this unpacked extension (i.e., add it to your Chrome) by following [these](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) instructions.

## How to Use

The extension is on by default when loaded. To toggle it off/on, click its name in the Extensions menu.

### Coming Soon:

* ~~An actual toggle in the extension popup for a sleeker toggling experience.~~ ✅
* No sliding animation when the extension is enabled and you open the popup.
* Icon colour change to indicate on/off status, rather than a badge.
